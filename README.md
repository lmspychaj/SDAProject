We have seperate directories for the 2 databases we used and any other files related to them, such as the code used for filtering.
There is also a folder "land" which contains files that are used to calculate the land ratio for each latitude and longitude in 'latslongs.py'. These values can be found in the 'Cosine and uniform' file, 

hypothesis2mass,  hypothesis2loc and hypothesis2class create the results and plots from the RQ "Are there differences between fallen and found meteorites"
project.py is used for the RQ "Is there periodicity in the amount of fallen meteorites"?
hypothesis4.py is used for the question "Are there trends in the location of fallen meteorites?"
